Baymax in Winter Wonderland

Purpose:
Learning how to model something I find interesting (Baymax + Winter) using the concepts we learn in class like camera, texture mapping, geometrical functions, and colors. Additionally, finding a way to get keyboard inputs to interact with the objects in the scene (like moving Baymax). 

User Interaction:
This program intakes the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move the Baymax model. The keys functions are as followed: 
"left" : rotate left
"right": rotate right
"up": moves forward
"down": moves backward 

Techniques used:
1. Using Three.js built-in geometrical functions to create Christmas trees, snowman, Baymax, bench, and the ice skating rink. 
2. Using curved lines to add details Baymax (the smile) and also a little heart on top of his Christmas hat. I think it's just a cute little detail to make the model a bit more interesting to look at.
3. Using colors to make everything colorful and festive. Transparency is used for the ice rink to make it look icy.
4. Using transformation to scale trees (varying sizes) and scaling snowman, and moving them around the scene. Rotation is used for Baymax when user click either the left or right arrow key on the keyboard. 
5. Using cameras and light to set up the scene and make everything looks bright and presentable.
6. Using textures to map the walls and the ground of the scene with a winter theme image.
7. Using animation by having a user keyboard input (and moving Baymax around the scene).


Resources:
I used Stemkoski's THREEx.KeyboardState to get the user keyboard input and also a chunk of his code on to rotate/translate model based on which key is clicked.
